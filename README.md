# American Express User Churn Prediction

This project builds a predictive model to identify users likely to churn from American Express services. It uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze customer data and make accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoded categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features to improve ANN performance.
- **ANN Implementation**: Built a neural network with two hidden layers using TensorFlow.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.

## Libraries Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn (for preprocessing and metrics)

## How to Use
1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn
2.Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Amex-Churn-Prediction.git
3.Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train the ANN, and evaluate its performance.
